# Python_Challenge

This is the Module 3 Homework assignment. There are two separate folders. PyBank contains 3 folders: the starter code and my code in main.py, the csv where my data comes from in Resources, and an anlysis in analysis. My script reads in the csv file. Then it stores the different rows as variables. 
It loops through the data to find the months that changed. It calculates the change from month to month and compares that to the changes that have 
already been calculated to evuntually find the total number of months, and which dates had the greatest increase or decrease. The output is then
sent to an easy to read synopsis in the analysis folder.

The PyPoll folder also contains 3 folders. The starter code and my changes are stored in main.py. The csv which contains the data is in 
Resources, and an analysis in analysis. This script reads in the csv and creates dictionaries to store the candidates and their votes. It loops through the data to count the total number of votes and ultimately give us who won the election. The results are then output to a text file which is 
stored in the analysis folder.
